# Site-Members Module for Joomla!
Site Members Module for Joomla!

This very simple module reports the total users in the selected usergroup. It is intended to be invoked via a {loadposition XXX} placeholder in an article, but it can certainly be a standalone module in an actual template position. No formatting is applied whatsoever, but that can be done in the module configuration panel (default Joomla! feature).

Compatible with Joomla! 3+.
